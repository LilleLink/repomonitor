<h1>Interface for monitoring master-pushes to Github repositories<h1>

Why use githubs excellent built-in notification system that has the capability to alert contributers through notifications and email, when you can use this app to do it?

Just a project for me to mess around with node.js/express/ejs/apis with a veru vauge goal.
